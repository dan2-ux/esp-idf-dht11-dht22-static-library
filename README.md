# Welcome to DHT11 and DHT22 repository
This is a ready-to-use component with a clean API that only requires developers to define the pins. It is designed for the ESP32 to work with the temperature sensor, allowing developers to focus on integrating the features provided by the DHT11 and DHT22 into their own projects.

## DHT11 & DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

This repository demonstrates how to interface DHT11 and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors using a single-wire digital protocol.

Both sensors provide temperature and relative humidity data and are commonly used in embedded and IoT projects.

## Sensor Overview
- DHT11 is suitable for basic applications

- DHT22 provides higher accuracy and a wider measurement range

## How It Works

DHT sensors communicate using a single data wire with a strict timing-based protocol.

#### The microcontroller:

1. Sends a start signal to the sensor

2. Waits for the sensor response

3. Reads 40 bits of data:

- 16 bits humidity

- 16 bits temperature

- 8 bits checksum

## GPIO Configuration

#### Data pin is configured as:

- Output during the start signal

- Input while receiving data

A pull-up resistor is required on the data line (usually built into the module).

## Communication Timing

- Timing accuracy is critical

- Each bit is determined by how long the data line stays HIGH

- A checksum is used to verify data integrity

If timing is incorrect, the read operation will fail.
